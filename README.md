2D Steady Diffusion Equation using Numerical Methods     

Solving the 2D steady diffusion equation in planar geometry with Dirichlet Boundary condition using Python. Utilized the advanced numerical methods, resulting in accurate and reliable solutions.

Generated 2D and 3D graphs to illustrate the diffusion process and authored a comprehensive report showcasing attention to detail, presenting the project's methodology, observations, and conclusions.
